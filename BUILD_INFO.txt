To fix for AL1073 x64 error mrcorlib.dll (if needed):

Create an MsBuildAL1073WarningWorkaround.targets file (name doesn't matter) and add it to the project. It has the following contents:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory Condition=" '$(PlatformTarget)' == 'x64'">$(TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory)$(PlatformTarget)\</TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>  



Edit the .csproj file to import this file near the end of the file (where you'll see the comment that says "To modify your build process...":
 <Import Project="MsBuildAL1073WarningWorkaround.targets" />
 <!-- To modify your build process... -->
