A simple software for Windows to rename lists of files

_The project is no longer maintained for several years, but fully working,
the only part that require attention is The TVDB integration, that use a old API not more available._

The source code will be kept here as a reference and for possible evolutions by enthusiasts.
The website http://www.autorinomina.it/ will be closed at the end of 2020.

## History

This software was born in the far February 2009 the result of my desire for good renaming the files, but also from my passion in programming.
In the course of time and thanks to the suggestions of my fans have been able to improve it and make it become a true software.

This software was initially born to rename episodes files of Tv Shows,
so automatically filters out bad words based on a blacklist with the ability to automatically reposition each portion of text in the filename.

Example:<br/>
From: The.TvShow.Name.6x06.Deep.Waters.ITA.WEBRip.x264.mkv<br/>
Result: 6x06 - The TvShow Name - Deep waters.mkv

In the latest versions it has been extended to rename any other file type, like images, sounds, documents...<br/>
with the possibility to include in the file names extra information such as metadata, ID3-TAG, EXIF, etc...

## Main features

- Simultaneously rename files from different folders<br/>
You can add files from different folders to rename all at once
- Sort functions<br/>
The sort function can be applied to e.g. the filename, type, date created ...
- Preview of the new file names<br/>
With the preview you can view the new file names, edit the results and in the case check for any problems such as duplicate names.
- Reading metadata information<br/>
The metadata information (EXIF, IPTC, ID3) which are automatically inserted by camera or audio devices, can be used to rename the files.
- Custom numbering<br/>
Each file can be numbered keeping its original numbering, or creating a new one using different styles such as (01,02,03  I,II,III  1x01, 1x02 ...)
- Black-list words<br/>
Using this list you can remove words from the file names automatically (it is applied using the "Filter from the filename").
- Use the contents of a text file<br/>
You can rename files using the contents of a text file (TXT) or by using copy/paste to any editor. Each line of text in the file will be transferred to each file to be renamed.
- Access to the database of the TV series The TVDB<br/>
Use one of the largest databases of TV series to rename your files
- Save the configurations with the presets<br/>
The presets allow you to save/retrieve different configurations to rename the files according to your needs. You can also download them from the tutorial and share those that you create with anyone.
